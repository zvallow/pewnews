			<p><strong>	Pew News is PewDiePie's news show that premiered on February 3, 2018. Despite it being his news show, he only was a news anchor for the first episode. He has hired many reporters to report for him but lately, Gloria Borger has been a recurring reporter on the show in which it's possible PewDiePie was unsatisfied with the other reporters. The show involves actual internet news topics, similar to DramaAlert, but reports on fewer topics and is a weekly show. Lasers are executed all over the place at the start of a news topic.</strong></p>
